<!-- Uses markdown syntax for neat display at github. This is the most important thing to your user. Be not afraid that
	you are too long-winded. If you tell someone what the Battacharyya distance is, they probably will appreciate
	that even if they already know. Be also clear about its complexity, say if it is exponential in time or the 
	number of pixels for example. 

	Tips on syntax:
	
	Use pictures:
	  ![picture](https://raw.github.com/git_username/git_repos/master/module_name/some_doc_folder/picture.jpg)

	Use math notation (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11256433):
	- Experiment on http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?c=\sqrt{E/m} to check your equation
	- Encode the math part c=\sqrt{E/m} on http://www.url-encode-decode.com/urlencode
	- And write it in markdown syntax as:
	   ![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?c%3D%5Csqrt%7BE%2Fm%7D)
